# Shipping Emission Project
This project was funded by Enviorment and Climate Change Canada. The Shipping Emission Project (SEP) quantified the impacts of Canadian black carbon shipping emissions on Arctic climate. I used Canadian Earth System Model to simulate (CanESM) to simulate the climate and Python for analysis and visualization.
